# From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s package manager
# everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
# course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
# container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
# to be run directly in the container.

# "docker pull debian" - first
# "docker run -it debian" - will go to debian shell
# apt-get - command that installs packages on linux(debian)

# need to do commands below in debian shell
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install git

# "exit" - to exit from shell
